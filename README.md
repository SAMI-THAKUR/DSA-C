# Data Structures and Algorithms in C ðŸ“š

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository in C! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. It's primarily intended for my college and personal learning, but it's open for anyone to explore and learn from.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find  C code for common data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

Here are some of the data structures implemented in this repository:
- **Stacks**: Implementation of stacks and its applications.
- **Queue**: Implementation of queue and its type like Circular Queue, DEqueue, Priority Queue
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, Stack & Queue using Linked List


Happy coding and learning! ðŸš€
